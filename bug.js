This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The issue is that the `onBarCodeScanned` function is not always called when a barcode is scanned. This is inconsistent and leads to unpredictable behavior. The code might work intermittently or not at all, making debugging frustrating. The problem seems linked to how Expo handles the barcode scanning process internally; sometimes, events are missed or dispatched incorrectly.
